### Startup Classification-Recommender System

The goal of this project was to first build a model from available Crunchbase data that predicts most probble event(normal operating, ipo, acquisition or closure) to happen to a startup and secondly to explore recommender algorithms and then build a hybrid recommender system of startups which investors could potentially use. We have not yet built the second part(recommender system) and which we will build progressively till it is accomplished.
